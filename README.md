# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)


[Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).




As a CS major student and a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Edx. I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. There are discussion forums on most MOOC platforms, however, even a question with detailed description may need some time to be answered..This course is almost the simple and clear deep learning course I have ever taken, but the simplicity is based on the fabulous course content and structure. It's a real treasure given by deeplearning.ai team.
